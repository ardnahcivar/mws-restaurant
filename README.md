## Description

Mobile Web Specialists are trained in building **Progressive Web Apps** (PWAs, see [Google](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) and [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive)). PWAs are like a combination of web apps and native apps, improving on the best features of each. I learned how to build PWAs in the [Udacity Google Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024).
I was awarded a scholarship to this Nanodegree program after completing the [Google India Challenge Scholarship](https://in.udacity.com/google-india-scholarships) Udacity challenge course, intermediate web developer track, in the top 10% of 10,000 students. 

See the [Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree Certificate](https://confirm.udacity.com/HXHQJZFU)

In this Nanodegree program, I built a restaurant reviews PWA that displays restaurant locations and info. The app provides offline access through the Service Worker, IndexedDB, and web manifest files. Users can add favorites and reviews for restaurants. If changes are made offline, they sync to the web server when network access is restored.
